# These people are my lovely and helpful TAs.

I started my major at uni as a real beginner.So the only way I could become better and better was a help from people who have more experience than me.Fortunately , I found some great TAs with the help of Dr.Etemadi who is one of the best techers H've ever had.Now with the help of our Professor and TAs I'm not anymore a beginner who doesn't know anything abot programming.
