## My new friend and I in Skype
People in the picture are:
- Ali Alaei
- Me


This is an article about how to be success in computer engineering.I interviewd with a successful and fantastic friend in in this field.Ali Alaei,who I interviewed with,got me lost of his important experients.I asked lots of questions and Ali answered all of the them completely.  
I understood that the first language Ali learned C++.He also told me that all of the lessons that are specifically related to computer are important like Fondations of computer & programming,Advanced computer programming,Data structures,algorithm analysis and design and software engineering.
I asked him about going abroad or staying in Iran and he told me that it totally depends on your goals and you.If you want to design a OS ,Iran doesn't have its basics,but if want to make a start-up or programs Iran has lost of opportunities.Iran also has a lot of chances you can gain,too.
Furthermore,he told me that your degree is very important if you want to apply or become a professor at uni or do researches.If you want to work,it helps you but it isn't enough and you should work and make experience.   
In addition,he told me that in his leisure time he sing and play musical instrument because he love art.he also added that sport is an essential part of his life.
Special thanks to Ali because of giving his precious time to Me and to Dr.Etemadi who has caused Me to get to know Ali.
