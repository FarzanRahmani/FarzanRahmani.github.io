I han an interview with Ali Rahnama Alamdari about how to success.Thanks to Ali, I found out much things.
First,you should understand how to sue apps especially online apps because with the use of them you can study especially in days of Covid-19.
Then,you have to plan your schedule to give proper time to each lesson.After that, you should try a sport,because sports help your body and mind.You also need to be hard-working because your path to the peak of success isn't easy at all.
Finally he suggested me to sum up the important things in your class so that you can easily remember them at the exam.
